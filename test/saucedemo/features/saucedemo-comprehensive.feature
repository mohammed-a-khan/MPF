Feature: SauceDemo E2E Testing - Comprehensive Framework Demo
  As a test automation engineer
  I want to demonstrate all CS Framework capabilities
  So that I can validate the complete testing solution

  Background:
    Given I navigate to the SauceDemo application
    And I should see the login page with all required elements

  @smoke @priority:high @TestCase-415

    And the page should load within 3 seconds

  @regression @priority:medium @TestCase-416

    Then all test cases should execute successfully
    And test results should be logged to ADO

  @performance @priority:medium

    When I login with username "standard_user" and password "secret_sauce"
    Then the page should load within 5 seconds
    And performance metrics should be captured

  @negative @priority:medium
  Scenario: Error handling and recovery

    Then I should see an error message
    And the error should be logged appropriately

  @api @database @priority:low
  Scenario: Multi-protocol testing demonstration
    Given I have test data prepared
    When I execute API validation tests
    And I execute database validation tests
    Then all test protocols should pass

  @ai_healing @priority:high
  Scenario: AI self-healing capabilities
    Given I have elements that may fail
    When I perform actions that trigger healing
    Then the framework should auto-heal broken locators
    And healing actions should be logged

  @parallel @priority:medium
  Scenario: Parallel execution demonstration
    When I execute parallel test scenarios
    Then all scenarios should run concurrently
    And results should be properly aggregated

  @reporting @priority:high
  Scenario: Comprehensive reporting validation
    When I complete all test scenarios
    Then HTML report should be generated
    And PDF report should be created
    And Excel report should be available
    And JSON results should be exported
    And XML results should be available

  @ado_integration @priority:high
  Scenario: Azure DevOps integration
    When I execute tests with ADO integration
    Then test results should be published to ADO
    And test case status should be updated
    And work items should be linked appropriately
